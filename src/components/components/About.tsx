                  Missed the Doge? Shiba? Dogelon Mars? And others? Missed Pepe
                  this year? Did you also miss copies of them that weren't all
                  made just for the community? But you can still be strong part
                  of the new community? Yes? Either way, Punchi, the magic cosmo
                  cat, was born to connect all communities and open the gateway
                  to unbelieveable gains and takeover the meme space with secret
                  formulas.
                </p>

                  Launching with zero taxes and locked LP, $PUNCHI is a coin for
                  the people, forever. Fueled by pure memetic power, and magic
                  cosmic dust, let Punchi rise and shine. Made by veterans.
